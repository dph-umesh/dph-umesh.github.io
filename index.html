          <p>
            I am a polyglot developer, with an ability to pickup on any programming languages in no time.
            I am comfortable working on any programming languages because I believe that programming language is
            just a tool to represent our ideas. At the time of writing this webpage, I am well versed with
            Javascript, React.js, HTML, CSS, Python (along with numpy and pandas) and C++.
